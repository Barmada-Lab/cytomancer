# CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool)

Our lab uses CVAT for annotating microscopy data. There are a number of benefits to using CVAT to annotate your data, but the main benefit of using CVAT over other tools is that CVAT supports semi-automated annotation, meaning less work for the annotator. A second, possibly more impactful benefit of using CVAT is a systematic benefit; by organizing our annotated data in one place with a known format, it becomes much simpler to develop and test fully automated annotation algorithms.
