# Turbo Network Fileshare

Turbo is our lab's main fileshare. It allows us to centralize our storage, so that experimental data can be accessed from many locations without having to copy things around.

To mount our Turbo share on a local machine, follow the instructions [here](https://arc.umich.edu/turbo/turbo-user-guide/).
